    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we install **Flask**, we need to create a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Installing virtualenv\n",
    "\n",
    ">**virtualenv** is a useful tool that creates isolated Python development environments where you can do all your development work. Suppose you come across a new Python library that you'd like to try. If you install it system-wide, there is the risk of messing up other libraries that you might have installed. Instead, use virtualenv to create a sandbox, where you can install and use the library without affecting the rest of your system. You can keep using this sandbox for ongoing development work, or you can simply delete it once you've finished using it. Either way, your system remains organized and clutter-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install **virtualenv**, simply do:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Creating virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing virtualenv, you can create a new isolated development environment in your project folder like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "virtualenv myvenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, **myvenv** is the name of your virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you have to activate it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For ubuntu and mac users:\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    myvenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 3. Install flask\n",
