    ">A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines).\n",

    "- Requires fewer resources\n",
    "- Concise and powerful\n",
