    "### Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreter is nothing but a software which can run your Python scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, it can be implemented in any programming language!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPython** is the default interpreter for Python which is written in **C language**.\n",
    "- **Jython** is another popular implementation of python interpreter written using **Java**.\n",

    "- **What does the compiler do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiler compiles your **source code (the statements in your file)** into a format known as **byte code**.\n",
    "Compilation is simply a **translation step**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Byte code is a:\n",
    "- lower level,\n",
    "- platform independent,\n",
    "- efficient and \n",
    "- intermediate\n",
    "\n",
    "representation of the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roughly, each of your source statements is translated into a group of byte code instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This byte code translation is performed to speed execution—byte code can be run much quicker than the original source code statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What does the Python Virtual Machine do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as **source code** gets converted to **byte code**, it is fed into **PVM (Python Virtual Machine)**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The PVM sounds more impressive than it is; really, it’s just a big loop that iterates through your byte code instructions, one by one, to carry out their operations. The PVM is the runtime engine of Python; it’s always present as part of the Python system, and is the component that truly runs your scripts. Technically, it’s just the last step of what is called the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## .pyc files\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a Python script is executed, ByteCode is generated in memory and simply discarded when program exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if a Python module is imported, a **.pyc** file for the module is generated which contains its Byte code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, when the module is imported next time, the byte code from **.pyc** file is used, hence skipping the compilation step!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to create a **.pyc** file for a module that is not imported, you can use the **py_compile** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **py_compile** module can manually compile any module. One way is to use the py_compile.compile function in that module interactively:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import py_compile\n",
    "py_compile.compile('abc.py')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will write the .pyc to the same location as abc.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also automatically compile all files in a directory or directories using the **compileall** module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python -m compileall .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look at the byte code using the dis module!\n",

    "def hello():\n",
    "    print \"hello!\"\n",
